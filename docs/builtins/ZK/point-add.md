| Argument | Type | Description |

### Return value

The `point-add` function returns the result of adding the specified points together.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates the use of `point-add` in the Pact REPL:

```pact
pact>(point-add 'g1 {'x': 1, 'y': 2} {'x': 1, 'y': 2})
```

In this example, `point-add` is used to add the two specified points together on the curve BN254. The type of addition is 'g1', and the points are provided as dictionaries with 'x' and 'y' coordinates.
