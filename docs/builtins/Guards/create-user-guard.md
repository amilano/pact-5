## create-user-guard
Use `create-user-guard` to define a custom guard `CLOSURE` whose arguments are strictly evaluated at definition time and supplied to the indicated function at enforcement time.

### Basic syntax

To define a custom guard `CLOSURE` for use in Pact, use the following syntax:

`(create-user-guard CLOSURE)`

### Arguments

Use the following argument to specify the `CLOSURE` for the `create-user-guard` Pact function.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLOSURE` | `closure` | Specifies the custom guard closure to define. The closure is a function that takes no arguments and returns a boolean value. |

### Return values

The `create-user-guard` function returns a guard that utilizes the specified custom `CLOSURE`.

### Example

The following example demonstrates the `create-user-guard` function:

```pact
(create-user-guard (read-keyset 'my-keyset))
```

In this example, `(read-keyset 'my-keyset)` is used to obtain a keyset, and this keyset is then used as a custom guard closure in `create-user-guard`. The closure captures the keyset at definition time, and it will be supplied to the indicated function at enforcement time. This allows for custom user-defined guards based on specific keysets or conditions.
