## fold
Use `fold` to iteratively reduce a list by applying a function `APP` to the last result and each element, starting with an initial value `INIT`.

### Basic syntax

To iteratively reduce a list by applying a function to each element, starting with an initial value, use the following syntax:

`(fold APP INIT LIST)`

### Arguments

Use the following arguments to specify the function, initial value, and list for the `fold` Pact function:

| Argument | Type       | Description                                       |
|----------|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `APP`      | `x:<a> y:<b> -> <a>` | Specifies the function to apply to each element and the last result. |
| `INIT`     | `<a>`       | Specifies the initial value for the reduction.    |
| `LIST`     | `[<b>]`     | Specifies the list to iterate over.               |

### Return values

The `fold` function returns the final result of the iterative reduction of the list.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates the `fold` function:

```pact
pact>(fold (+) 0 [100 10 5])
115
```

In this example, `(+)` is used as the function to apply, which is addition in this case. The `fold` function starts with an initial value of `0` and iteratively adds each element of the list `[100 10 5]` to the previous result. Here's the breakdown:

- Initial value: `0`
- First iteration: `0 + 100 = 100`
- Second iteration: `100 + 10 = 110`
- Third iteration: `110 + 5 = 115`

The final result of the `fold` operation is `115`. The `fold` function is commonly used for operations that require accumulating results over a list in Pact contracts.
