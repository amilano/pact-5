## or?
Use `or?` to apply logical 'or' with short-circuit evaluation to the results of applying a value to two application functions.

### Basic syntax

To apply logical 'or' with short-circuit evaluation to the results of applying a value to two application functions, use the following syntax:

`(or? a b value)`

### Arguments

Use the following arguments to specify the application functions and the value to be applied using the `or?` Pact function.

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `a` | `x:<r> -> bool` | Specifies the first application function. |
| `b` | `x:<r> -> bool` | Specifies the second application function. |
| `value` | `<r>` | Specifies the value to be applied to both application functions. |

### Return value

The `or?` function returns a boolean value representing the logical 'or' operation with short-circuit evaluation applied to the results of applying the value to the two application functions.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates the use of `or?` in the Pact REPL:

```pact
pact>(or? (> 20) (> 10) 15)
true
```

In this example, the value `15` is applied to the application functions `>(20)` and `>(10)`. The logical 'or' operation with short-circuit evaluation is performed on the results, resulting in `true`.
